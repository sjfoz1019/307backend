What I learned during the learning sprint was being able to
- Implement a RecyclerView 
- Give functionalities to buttons and item clicks of RecyclerView
- Implement a tab layout with an adapter based on how many tabs we wanted in our app(didn't get used in the final product)
- Having multiple layouts in one XML file is a pain to work with when trying to add new fields
- Must add new AppActivites into the Android Manifest
- The basics of kotlin
- Grab input values from text fields and input them into the list for a RecyclerView
